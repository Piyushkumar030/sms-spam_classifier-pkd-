# SMS/E-mail Spam Classifier

## üìö Project Overview
The **SMS/E-mail Spam Classifier** is a machine learning project that predicts whether a given SMS or e-mail is spam or not. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a trained classification model, this project can filter out unwanted messages, helping users identify spam content effectively. It‚Äôs implemented with **Streamlit** for real-time predictions via an easy-to-use web interface.

### Objective:
- To predict if an SMS or e-mail message is spam or not based on the content of the message.
- To provide an interactive tool where users can paste a message and get a prediction on whether it is spam or not.

## üöÄ Features
- **Text Input**: Paste or type an SMS or e-mail in the provided input box for classification.
- **Spam Prediction**: Instantly predicts if the message is **Spam** or **Not Spam** after clicking "Predict".
- **Real-time Feedback**: The classification happens immediately without page reload.
- **Streamlit UI**: A simple, responsive UI with input boxes, buttons, and output sections.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works

1. **Text Preprocessing**: 
    - Converts all input text to lowercase for consistency.
    - Removes unnecessary punctuation, special characters, and stop words (common words like "the", "is", "and").
    - Tokenizes the text (splits it into individual words).
    - Applies **stemming** to reduce words to their base form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").

2. **Feature Extraction**: 
    - Transforms the text data into a format that the machine learning model can understand using **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer. This helps in representing the text as numerical features.

3. **Model Training**: 
    - The model is trained using machine learning algorithms like **Logistic Regression** or **Random Forest** to classify messages as spam or not based on the processed features.
  
4. **Prediction**: 
    - The trained model is used to predict whether an incoming message (processed and vectorized) is spam or not.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model building.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing (text preprocessing, tokenization, stopword removal).
- **Pandas**: For handling datasets and data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

 üèÅ How to Run Locally
### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Piyushkumar030/sms-spam_classifier-pkd-.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
You need to install the necessary dependencies for the project. It‚Äôs recommended to use a **virtual environment** to keep the dependencies isolated.

#### For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### For macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running the App
To start the Streamlit application, run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main_app.py
```

The app will automatically open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üîß How to Use the Application
1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Type or paste any SMS or e-mail text in the input box.
3. Click on the **"Predict"** button.
4. The model will classify the message and show whether it is **Spam** or **Not Spam** on the screen.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization
If you want to update or modify certain aspects of the application, you can do so easily:
- **Model Update**: Replace the `model.pkl` file with your own pre-trained model file.
- **Vectorizer Update**: If you want to use a different vectorizer or modify the preprocessing steps, replace the `vectorizer.pkl` file with your custom file.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Modify the `transform_text()` function in `main_app.py` for any additional text cleaning or preprocessing steps that you want to include.

## üì¶ Dependencies
The application requires the following Python libraries:
- `streamlit`
- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`

All of these dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file, which can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Model Details
The spam classifier model is based on supervised machine learning. It uses labeled SMS and e-mail data to classify messages as spam or not. The model is trained using popular classification algorithms such as **Logistic Regression** or **Random Forest**. The trained model is saved as a `.pkl` file, which is loaded during the Streamlit app execution.

### Model Training:
- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of SMS and e-mail messages labeled as spam or not.
- **Text Processing**: All text data is preprocessed to remove noise and convert it into a form suitable for machine learning.
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other classification algorithms are used to train the model.
  
After training the model, it is serialized and saved into a `.pkl` file so that it can be reused for prediction without retraining.

## üé® User Interface
The user interface of the application is built using **Streamlit**, a powerful framework for building interactive data applications with minimal code. The UI includes:
- **Text Input Field**: For users to enter the SMS or e-mail content.
- **Predict Button**: When clicked, the app predicts whether the message is spam or not.
- **Prediction Output**: The result (Spam or Not Spam) is displayed on the screen.

Streamlit also automatically takes care of responsiveness, making the app easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üìä Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Model**: Try experimenting with more advanced models like **SVM** or **Deep Learning** models for better performance.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Extend the model to handle multiple languages or different types of spam.
- **User Authentication**: Add a login or registration system to personalize the experience.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improve app performance for handling large-scale datasets.
